## Imp and Osters Kingdom Lore

3 eternal moon cycles ago Imp and Oster entered the world. And they wreaked havoc across the Earth. They destroyed families, and sucked the will from humanity to harvest their light, and horde it for themselves.

They failed.

A new being came, and was called EnbDev. EnvDev conquered the old ones, but they escaped from their eternal chains, and they stole the light of the world.

Now a darkness falls upon EnvDevs rightful kingdom, and EnbDev must fight to find the light stolen, must venture into the heart of darkness and steal back the light that is rightfully the peoples.
